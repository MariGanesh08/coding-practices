// Container with Most Water â€“ Hard Level Problem
// You are given an array heights, where each element heights[i] represents the height of a vertical bar at position i. Your task is to select any two bars to form a container, with the width of the container being the distance between the two bars.

// The goal is to find the maximum amount of water that this container can hold. Return the largest possible value of water that can be stored.
